# Virtual Organ Using HTML, CSS, Arduino & Relays

## Overview  
This project uses **HTML, CSS, and Arduino** to create a virtual organ that allows users to input musical notes. The input is sent to an Arduino board, which controls relays to produce sound effects. This project is designed for DIY electronic music enthusiasts who want to experiment with relay-based sound generation.

## Features  
- Virtual organ interface built with HTML and CSS  
- Input signals sent to Arduino for processing  
- Relay-based music playback system  
- Real-time interaction between user input and Arduino  
- Expandable to support additional musical components  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML & CSS** for the graphical user interface  
- **Arduino** for processing the inputs  
- **Relays** to trigger external sound-producing components  

## Requirements  
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)  
- Relay module  
- Electrical components for sound generation (e.g., buzzer, speakers)  
- USB cable for Arduino connection  
- Web browser to access the virtual organ interface  

## Installation and Setup  

### Step 1: Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thushan99/horn-project-with-organ.git
cd horn-project-with-organ
